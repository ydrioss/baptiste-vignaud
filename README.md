Hello, you beautiful people.
This is my personal website, it already exists but it's all static (and not even responsive, I made it on an emergency).
I figured I could "symfonize" it, so here I go.

One last thing, I'm still a beginner on Symfony, so if you see something bad, please don't hesitate to correct me.
Thanks!
